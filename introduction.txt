Brief Introduction About Myself

Hello! My name is Fabiola. I am passionate about learning technology and improving my skills in programming and software development. I'm especially interested in working on real-world projects and collaborating with others especial in ALX-Community and at work.

I created this repository as part of my learning journey on GitHub, and I look forward to using this platform to host, track, and contribute to exciting projects.
